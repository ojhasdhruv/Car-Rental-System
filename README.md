# Car Rental System


**Description**: Developed a dynamic Car Rental System in Java, following a structured, step-by-step approach to ensure clarity and effectiveness.

# Problem-Statement
The current manual processes for managing car rentals are inefficient, error-prone, and lack scalability. Rental agencies struggle to track car availability, manage customer reservations, and accurately calculate rental prices. This often leads to customer dissatisfaction, operational inefficiencies, and financial discrepancies. There is a need for an automated, user-friendly system that can streamline the entire car rental process, ensure accurate pricing, and enhance the overall customer experience. The solution should be maintainable and scalable to adapt to future requirements and expansions.



# Key-Responsibilities:

**Class Structure:**

Designed and implemented core classes such as Car, Rental, Customer, and Pricing to encapsulate the essential attributes and behaviors.
Established relationships and interactions between these classes to maintain a cohesive system architecture.

**OOP Principles:**

Utilized core Object-Oriented Programming principles including inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction.
Ensured the system was maintainable and scalable, allowing for easy future enhancements and modifications.

**User Interaction:**

Developed a user-friendly console interface to enable users to perform various car rental operations such as booking, returning, and viewing available cars.
Implemented intuitive navigation and clear prompts to enhance user experience and facilitate smooth interactions.

**Pricing Calculation:**

Implemented robust algorithms to calculate rental prices dynamically based on factors such as rental duration, car type, and any additional services.
Ensured accuracy and fairness in pricing through comprehensive testing and validation.
Technologies Used: Java, OOP, Console Interface.

# Outcome 

Delivered a fully functional car rental system that:

Demonstrated effective application of OOP principles, resulting in a maintainable and scalable system architecture.
Enhanced user experience through a clear and efficient console interface, enabling seamless car rental interactions.
Achieved accurate and reliable pricing calculations, ensuring transparency and user satisfaction.
Additional Details:

# Testing

Conducted thorough testing to ensure all functionalities worked as intended and the system was free of critical bugs.
Documentation: Created comprehensive documentation to guide users and future developers in understanding and utilizing the system.
Team Collaboration: Worked collaboratively with a team of developers, participating in code reviews and iterative improvements based on feedback.
This project showcases my ability to design, implement, and deliver a complex software system using Java and OOP principles, with a strong emphasis on user experience and system reliability.
